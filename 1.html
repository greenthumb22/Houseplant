<h2>Monstera Deliciosa</h2>
<p><strong>Monstera deliciosa</strong> is a species of flowering plant native to <u>tropical forests</u> of southern Mexico, south to Panama. It has been introduced to many tropical areas, and has become a mildly invasive species in Hawaii, Seychelles, Ascension Island and the Society Islands.The specific epithet deliciosa means "delicious", referring to the edible fruit, while monstera means "monstrous", in reference to the size that this plant can grow to, over 9 m (30 ft) in many cases. Its popular name as a houseplant of "Swiss cheese plant", or just "cheese plant", is commonly stated to refer to the holes which develop in its leaves similar to the holes in some Swiss cheeses such as Emmental cheese.</p>
